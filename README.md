# BambaCharm
python IDE written in python
The project is a convenient IDE environment for Python, the main purpose of which is to allow the user to create Python files to write code in a convenient way and run it from the software itself.
The software will allow you to open and edit existing files, save files in the cloud and access them with the help of a registered user from any computer on which the software is installed.
Â In addition, the program will contain additional pizzas, such as the ability to write text files, open cmd cards from the software, Google tabs, summaries - some of them are ready in advance and summaries that the registered user will create and can share and more ...
The project came to mind after I noticed that during my programming experience I had to switch between the many different programs, between the typist and cmd to Google and educational files, which greatly slows down my work and causes discomfort. So I decided to create a development environment that would make it easier for me and other programmers to do the work, save me time and include all the things I would always like to be in the development environment in which I work. Today, there are many Python development environments in the market that can do a lot of different things, but what distinguishes my development environment is its simplicity combined with a broad option. Each advanced and advanced programmer will be able to install it and start using it easily on any computer, and all the options will be accessible and allow for easy use without the need for long and complicated settings that require using Google to understand them.
The software is written in Python and the graphical interface is built using the PyQt5 library and its graphic designer Qt Designer.
