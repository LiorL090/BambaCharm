# BambaCharm

The project is a convenient IDE environment for Python, the main purpose of which is to allow the user to create Python files to write code and run it from the software itself.
You can open and edit existing files, save files in the cloud and access them from any computer on which the software is installed.  In addition, the program will contain more Features, such as the ability to write text files, open terminal tabs and Google web tabs. 

The project came to mind after I noticed that during my programming experience I had to switch between the many different programs, between the IDE and cmd to Google, which greatly slows down my work and causes discomfort. So I decided to create a development environment that would make it easier for me and other programmers to do the work, save me time and include all the things I would always like to be in the development environment in which I work.

The program is written in Python and the graphical interface is built around PyQt5.
